 * mel_freq_spectrum.c 
 * 
 * This program will compute the Mel-Frequency Sprectrum in a given signal.
 *
 * The input will be the address of the structure that 
 * has the data after computing the power of the given signal and
 * the address structure to store the Mel-Frequency Spectrum.
 *
 * The Mel-Frequency spectrum is computed by Multiplying the Signal
 * Spectrum with a set of Triangular filters designed using Mel-Scale
 *
 * 
 * If 'f' is the frequency, then the mel of the frequency is given by
 * B(f) = 1125 log(1 + f/700 ) in mels
 *
 * If 'm' is the mel, then the corresponding frequency is given by
 * B^-1(m) = 700 exp(m/1125) - 700 in Hz
 *
 * Mel for 4000Hz is computed and is divided by 20. The Frequency 
 * Edge of each filter is computed by substituting the correspoding mel.
 * Having Found the edge frequences and center frequencies of the filter,
 * boundry points are computed to determine the transfer function of the filter
 * 
 * Boundry points are given by
 *
 *         N B^-1(B(fl) + m (1/21 B(fh) - 1/21 B(fl)))
 * f(m) = ---------------------------------------------
 *            		    fs
 *
 *
 * Here 'fs' is the sampling frequency, 'fh' is upper cut-off frequency
 * 'fl' lower cut-off frequency, 'N' is the total number of samples = 256
 * 'm' is the number denoting the filter number. (m=1 denotes first filter,
 * m=2 denotes second filter and so on )
 * 21 is the total number of filters + 1 = 20+1 = 21
 *
 *
 * After computing boundry points, Transfer function of the Filters are 
 * computed using the following formula
 *
 * H_m(k) = 0 ;								if k < f(m-1)
 *	      = (k-f(m-1))/(f(m)-f(m-1))  ; 	if f(m-1) <= k <= f(m)
 *        = (f(m+1) -k) / (f(m+1)-f(m)) ; 	if f(m) <= k <= f(m+1)
 *		  = 0 ; 							if k > f(m+1)
 *
 *
 * here 'm' denotes the filter number and 'f(m)' denotes the boundry points
 * and 'k' denotes the sample number 
 *
 * The above transfer function will result in a triangular function.
