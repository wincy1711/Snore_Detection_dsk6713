 * framing_windowing.c 
 * 
 * This program will compute receive the input sample and
 * will perform the Framing and Windowing Function
 * 
 * The input will be the address of the structure that 
 * has to store the data.
 * 
 * Split the input signal into frames. Each frame has 256 samples of
 * speech signal and the subsequent frame will start from the 100th
 * sample of the previous frame. Hence there will be a overlap
 *
 * Pictorial Representation.
 *
 * ---------------------------- ( First Frame)
 *          ---------------------------------- (Second Frame)
 *                          ------------------------------- (third frame)
 *
 * here each '-' can be considered as a speech sample.
 *
 *
 * each frame is applied with the window function. For the sake of efficiency
 * both framing and windowing is applied at the same time.
 *
 * Hamming Window is used. Hamming window is precomputed for Efficiency.
